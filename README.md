# Qualifying-Exam
Data file: simulatedcashflows.csv.zip (original file size is too large, .zip file was uploaded) Reset file reading path in code accordingly.

Code files:
  1. qualifying code_ coefficients model feature selection.ipynb: This section would take several days to implement, very long time.
  2. qualifying code.ipynb: This file is main file for project data analysis. Before running it, user should download vcboost/boost.py & loss.py through url: https://github.com/sply88/vcboost/tree/master/vcboost, and set system path on laptop to call them. Since these two packages were developed by Zhou and Hooker but not included in Python, it cannot be imported before downloading.
